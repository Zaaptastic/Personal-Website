						Hello, my name is Robert Chen, but you can call me Bobby. I am a fledgling developer, coffee lover, gaming enthusiast, swimmer turned water polo player and a hard worker who is deeply passionate about everything I do.

									<div class="section-text">
										I am a fun-loving and friendly person. I greatly enjoy creating polished products. I am always excited to learn new things. I am a dedicated worker who is also a great team player. I love solving challenges and I love competition. Both bring out the best in me.

									<div class="section-text">
										I am Computer Science major studying at Amherst College. I was a pre-medical student until the end of my Junior year (completed the MCAT and everything!), when I decided that path just wasn't for me. But that's a story for another time; I am now looking to pursue a career in Computer Science. I've yet to truly experience the field, and I look forward to the prospect of exploring it as much as I can.

									<div class="section-text">
										My favorite sports are Competitive Swimming and Water Polo, and I've participated in both for years. I'm no good at land sports, and that is unfortunately not a joke. I love painting, although I've only recently begun my journey into that world. I am an avid gamer, and my first steps into the world of Computer Science were from high school, when I wrote programs to assist my gameplay and contributed code and content to gaming websites. I find satisfaction in improving myself by learning new skills, fixing mistakes, and matching myself up against others.

									<div class="section-title">What are other fun facts about me?</div>
									<div class="section-text">
										I am a black coffee enthusiast (but mochas are a guilty pleasure). I love history. My favorite work of literature is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles_play)">Antigone</a>. My favorite movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a>. I like long walks in Nature, and shorter walks through busling cities. I've never been able to wrap my head around magic tricks.
