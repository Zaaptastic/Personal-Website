				<h1>Image Encrypt</h1>
				<p class="skills-used">Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP</p>
				<p class="project-info">Image Encrypt was a project I used to both practice my PHP as well as delve into the field of Cryptography. The web app uses the idea of Steganography to hide messages within an image, allowing such messages to be shared without an eavesdropper knowing an encrypted message even exists.<br><br>
				While not a formal "cipher", working on Image Encrypt allowed me to consider the implementations of cryptography in web apps. Additionally, many interesting features can be appended to the encryption algorithm, such as a fusion with One-Time Pad Encryption that could produce completely uncrackable encrypted images.</p>
