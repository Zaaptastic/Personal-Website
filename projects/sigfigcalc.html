				<h1>Significant Figure Calculator</h1>
				<p class="skills-used">Used: HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails</p>
				<p class="project-info">This web app was created as a way for me to practice using Ruby and Ruby on Rails. It is a relatively simple but effective calculator that automates the tedious task of significant figure rounding. I only wish I had through to write this app years ago for all those Chemistry courses... <br><br>
				Most fun to work on in this project was the back-end algorithm for determining significant figures. It presented quite a number of challenges, especially in the parsing of strings.</p>
